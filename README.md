Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a hotbed of research in data science these days and one of the most common applications of NLP is sentiment analysis. From opinion polls to creating entire marketing strategies, this domain has completely reshaped the way businesses work, which is why this is an area every data scientist must be familiar with.

Thousands of text documents can be processed for sentiment (and other features including named entities, topics, themes, etc.) in seconds, compared to the hours it would take a team of people to manually complete the same task.

Letâ€™s go through the problem statement once as it is very crucial to understand the objective before working on the dataset. The problem statement is as follows:

A sentiment analysis job about the problems of each major U.S. airline. Twitter data was scraped from February of 2015 and contributors were asked to first classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets, followed by categorizing negative reasons (such as "late flight" or "rude service").

The data we're providing on Kaggle is a slightly reformatted version of the original source. It includes both a CSV file and SQLite database.

I have gone through various Text Preprocessing step after that fitted my Text model using fastai library and then classified the Sentiments.
